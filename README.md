# Lossless-Data-Compression
A simple data compression software to compress big text files based on huffman algorithm.
1. To compress a textfile:
  * Run huffmanencode.cpp
  * Then enter the file path which has to be compressed
  * The compressed file is saved as <original_filename>compressed.dat
2. To decompress a file
  * Run huffmandecode.cpp
  * give the filepath for .dat file
  * The file will be restored as <original_filename>expanded.txt
